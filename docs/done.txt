Short log
    * First checkin, mirror of sketches base+20min hack
    * Renamed hack, moved into scripts.
    * Changed packaging template of pyexample to bbciot throughout
    * Debian packaging cleanup
    * Added some explanatory notes/aspirations to the README.md file
    * Added the todo/done files. Done pre-populated with contents of git shortlog
    * First extractions of hack into package
    * For tracking issues as they arise
    * Extracted reader code out to bbciot.reader.py
    * ignore generated files
    * Extracted collator code to bbciot.collator.py
    * Split single reader/fep: 2 scripts reader/collator
    * Reversed direction of clients/servers
    * Maintenance & startup changes - no longer auto start the systems - allowing integration with other things. (eg allows the FEP and tag reader code to be co-located inside the same process)
    * node_id is configurable at top level
    * Top level task "1. Implement Tag Reading Module" is complete
    * Top level task "2. FEP/Aggregator software" is complete
    * bbciot.core.Logger component created.
    * Logfile is configurable for TagReader
    * Logfile is configurable for Collator
    * Logfile for both now defaults to appending & flushing
    * Collator explicitly configures logfile and ports
    * TagReader explicitly configures all parameters
    * Collator logs conninfo, time and node record
    * Script to create run/logging directory - for development
       * Production would use the debian script
    * Top Level task "14. Implement local logging for TagReaders" is complete
    * Top Level task "4. Define Actuator Behaviour" is complete

    * Basic aggregate analysis component implemented.
        - Run as bbciot_aggregate_analyser
        - Outputs the set of tag ids seen over all time (for the given log file)
        - has a second mode which can cause it to drive an actuator
        - The actuator component is currently a stub and receive a PING message

    * Analyser can also run on a last X seconds basis now, in a timely fashion

    * Updated docs with current status
    * Packaging updates
    * minor updates to setup.py
    * Added local actuation tag stream trigger
    * Instrumented (but commented out) system delays
    * Implementation and integration of actuator code
    * Small code tidy

    * Now suitable for running as a standalone logging tag reader/actuator for offline analysis

    * Basic packaging updates

    * Copied onto github
    * Renamed bbciot to waypoint
    * Code tested on 3 machines with continual tag events over 3 days, with
      no faults ~10 tag events per second meaning ~7million tag events
      processed.


Data formats:
    * TagReader outputs records of form [timestamp, tagid, nodeid]
        * Timestamp is a float of seconds since the start of the 1970 unix epoch
            - This timestamp is the time of reading on the reader
        * tagid is a base 10 representation of the RFID tag id
        * nodeid is a passed through nodeid as configured by the tag reader (should be a string)

    * Collator (FEP) outputs log file of records of form:
        * [ conninfo, timestamp, noderecord]
            * conninfo is an object with following keys:
                localip - string - IP address
                localport - integer - port  number
                peer - string - IP address
                peerport - integer - port  number
            * timestamp is a float of seconds since the start of the 1970 unix epoch
                - This is the time on the collator at time of reception
            * noderecord is an unmodified record from tagreader

    * Actuator behaviour is to send a "ping" message to an outbox

            
Task log related complete:

  * 1. Implement Tag Reading Module
    Output: ( time, tag id, node id) (as JSON object)

  * 2. FEP / Aggregator software
    Could be a server or client, depending on whether nodes - tag raders - are clients or servers. TBD.
    Output: Data archive or log file of activity from tags on nodes

   * 14. Implement local logging for TagReaders

   * 4. Define Actuator Behaviour
        When the actuator analyser has analysed the data, it will cause
        the actuator to do something. A decision needs to be taken about
        what actuator is chosen and what the required behaviour should be.

   * 5 Implement Actuator analyser
        An analyser takes logged events from the data archive, processes
        them and triggers the actuator to do something.

        This is essentially an overall analyser which performs aggregate
        analysis. (eg total number of tag taps)

    * 3. Hardware set up for multiple tag readers

Log format: (on tag reader)

[1353334080.212733, 18446744072245347450, [1, "kamaelian"]]
[timestamp of read, tag id [nodeid, hostname/actuatorID]]


Log format: (on collator)

[{"peer": "127.0.0.1", "localip": "127.0.0.1", "peerport": 59787, "localport": 1600}, 1353334239.379761, [1353334078.582965, 18446744072245347450, [1,  "kamaelian"]]]

 [ conn_info_object, timestamp of reception, logline from tag reader ]
 Where
 conn_info_object is a json object with 4 keys:
     localip - IP of the collator
     localport - port the collator was listening on
     peer - IP of the peer
     peerport - ephemeral port allocated too the connection (allows for detection of identically configured tag readers but different - assuming not a plumbed connector)
